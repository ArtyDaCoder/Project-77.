        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages</p>
        <br>    
        To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + I (on Windows).

As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.

You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging. 
To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
